  # Point Zero


  Point Zero is a truly minimal micro-blog theme for Jekyll.


  ## Point Zero eschews many of the typical blogger "must-haves" in pursuit of an uncluttered and esoteric reading experience.


  This means:


  - no social sharing or following options

  - ~~no logo~~ logo option is now added to `config.yml` for structured data

  - no footer

  - no sitewide navigation

  - no link to homepage

  - no sidebars

  - no comments


  Additionally, the theme is meant to be :


  - Simple to use

  - Free to use

  - Semantic Markup

  - Minimal use of Javascript and CSS

  - High lighthouse scores

  - High Web Vitals scores


  ## So, what _does_ it have?


  - Point Zero will display your latest post on the homepage. The only navigation element from there, and throughout the site, is a single arrow icon that will randomly advance you to another post.

  - Sub navigation can be provided by adding recommended content (posts) via dropdown menu in the post editor.

  - Clicking the site title will not bring you back to the home page, but will display your `About` information.

  - The layout is clean, simple, and responsive.



  # Using the theme:


  This repository is a template.


  1. While logged into your GitHub account simply click the green button "Use this template"


  2. Give your repository a name and an optional description. (It's not necessary to include all branches.)


  3. In your newly created repository, open the `_config.yml` file in the root directory (_not_ the one in the `admin` directory)


  4. Edit the file to fill out the following fields:



  - `title:` This will display in the header and title meta tags.


  - `email:` Your email address, or address to the admin of the site.


  - `description:` A description of the site. [Use best paractices](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description).


  - `baseurl:` this is often left blank unless you are using a subdirectory of another site for the installation.


  - `url:` the base hostname & protocol for - your site, e.g. http://example.com.


  - `author:` the site author name. this can be you or the name of the site.


  - `logo:` the site logo. this won't currently display on the site, but is needed for structured data.



  5. From here you'll want to [follow these instructions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/02/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-4.0-on-netlify/#connecting-to-netlify) to launch the site on Netlify's free-tier:


  # Netlify CMS


  ## [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) is built-in with the following configuration fields:



  - `layout:` provides no options and is hidden in the post editor.


  - `title:` provides the post title and a sanitized slug/permalink based on the title content. ❗❗❗ Use a descriptive title and then do not change it unless you also want the permalink to change ❗❗❗


  - `date:` automatically generated upon creation of post, but can be updated in the CMS.


  - `image:` required for Jekyll SEO plugin and structured data.


  - `excerpt:` required for Jekyll SEO plugin and structured data.


  - `media (optional):` media adds one or more full-width image or YouTube embed types to the top of the post. Recommended 1 per post.


  - `post content (optional):` features a mini pagebuilder to add blocks of written content, images, and YouTube embeds to the post. Recommended at least one instance of WYSIWYG block.


  ## Authenticate on Netlify


  With the configuration already set-up, you'll just need to [follow these steps to enable authentication on Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication).



  Once the CMS is set up, you can access it via  {yoursite.com}/admin


  You can add content to the `about` modal via the Site Settings -> Site Info field.


  You can create new posts or edit existing posts via the `Post` post type.




  Although the purpose of this theme is somewhat esoteric in its exclusion of blogger "must-haves", you _can_ work around the limitations by leveraging the WYSIWYG editor in the `Post` post type if you desire.



  ## Plugins


  ### [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/discoform/shapes-for-jekyll-and-snipcart/projects/1)


  A Jekyll plugin to add metadata tags for search engines and social networks to better index and display your site's content.



  ### [Jekyll Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)

  Jekyll plugin to silently generate a sitemaps.org compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site.



  ### [Jekyll Autoprefixer](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-autoprefixer)

  This plugin provides simple autoprefixer support for Jekyll. To ensure compatibility with the latest version of Jekyll I've clamped the `execjs` gem to version 2.7.0, [per this issue](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/issues/160)


  ### [Jekyll Picture Tag](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag)


  The current configuration automatically builds resized images for most of your image library. I have not enabled `.webp` generation because the degradation in image sharpness is a little gross to look at. The settings can be found in `_data/picture.yml` if you're feeling adventurous.
