      John Whitney's demo reel of work created with his analog computer/film
      camera magic machine he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. 


      Also Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull (special fx wizard) to use the slit scan technique on 2001: A Space Odyssey
